1. Interim report 17.3.2021

- 1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet)

I have replaced the Location and Speed classes (and any other classes that would represent mathematical vectors) with my own data structure called VectorVariable.
This class contains methods for easier operations between vectors, for example to sum two vectors.
Also, I chose not to go with a grid on top of the simulation, which I talked about in the demo, but instead scanning the surroundings of every individual.

- What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?

Right now, I have tested all VectorVariable’s methods with unit tests and the followers’ and leader’s movement with the GUI.
I have also added velocity and force arrows for the individuals to see that everything seems to work correctly in the simulation.

- What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?

Getting the GUI to have other elements than just the simulation has been a bit frustrating.
Right now, I have gotten the GUI layout to work how I wanted.
I have not yet started working with threads and I will have to see how hard working with them will be.

- What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.

This week’s workload has been around 20 – 25 hours.
A lot of the time has been spent on looking up information about problems with the GUI and modeling the autonomous characters.

- Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).

I am currently roughly at the point I planned to be at.
I realized that I need to start thinking about the GUI earlier than I planned because it helps testing a lot as well as allows me to start looking into threads earlier.


ps. Sorry for the big initial commit. I was still figuring things out and wanted to get a good base for the rest of the program.




2. Interim report 31.3.2021

- 1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet)

I have added rest of the classes in my plan. Since the previous report I have made basic functionality for all of the classes in my program.
A big part of my focus has been on the GUI and making other classes work with it.
In the following weeks I will focus on polishing and adding the last missing functionalities to the classes.

- What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?

Everything new that has been added has been tested with running the simulation and in some cases with prints to see that they work correctly.

- What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?

I noticed that the followers weren't really following the leader correctly and would sometimes get stuck on the borders of the simulation for a while.
The problem seemed to come from a mistake in calculating the force with which the followers avoid the leader. It is now fixed.

- What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.

This week’s workload has been around 15 - 20 hours.

- Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).

I think I'm ahead of the plan but also I didn't think that things like learning to make the GUI would take so long.
I might not have as much time to spend on the project during the next two weeks due to exams coming up.




3. Interim report 14.4.2021

- 1-3 lines description of what classes have been added or updated and what functionality have been implemented in them (even if they were not ready yet)

I created a sector in front of the leader which the followers would avoid by moving to the sides. This didnt look as good a I thought so I don't know if I'll be implementing it.
It might work better if it's a square area instead of a sector similar to what was shown in Craig Reynold's article.

- What methods / functionality have been tested so far in classes so that they work properly?

Everything has been tested by running the application and many things with printing out values. Also the classes in VectorVariable have been tested with unit tests.

- What possibly difficult errors have occurred and have they been resolved?

Drawing the force and velocity arrows at right lenghts has been pretty difficult and I'm still working on it.
The problem is caused by the arrows getting suddenly very long because two followers get too close to eachother so the force become very high.
This could maybe be resolved with a square root or a logarithm to calculate the lenght.

- What has been the workload used during this time with some 5 hours accuracy.

5-10 hours. Figuring out a way to make the sector force took a long time because I explored multiple different approaches.
After the exam week I'll be ready to work on the project more.

- Whether you are ahead or lagging behind what you presented in the project plan (roughly at this phase).

I've pretty much completed all the requirements but there are still a lot of tweaking and some extra features I would like to implement.
